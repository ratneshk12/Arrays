An array is a linear data structure that stores multiple elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. Each element can be accessed using an index, which usually starts from 0.

🔹 Features

Stores homogeneous data (same type)

Fixed size

Fast access using index (O(1))

Stored in continuous memory

🔹 Example (Java)
int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

🔹 Types of Arrays

One-Dimensional Array

Two-Dimensional Array

Multi-Dimensional Array

🔹 Advantages

Easy and fast data access

Simple to use

Efficient for fixed-size data

🔹 Disadvantages

Fixed size (cannot grow dynamically)

Insertion and deletion are costly

Memory wastage may occur

📌 Use Case

Arrays are commonly used to store and manage collections of data such as marks, numbers, prices, and coordinates.
